## **New Update ⚠️**

We'd like to inform you of important changes to our distribution repository [nodesource/distributions](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions).

**What's New:**

- _**Package Changes:** DEB and RPM packages are now available under the `nodistro` codename. We no longer package the installer coupled to specific versions. This means you can install Node.js on almost any distro that meets the minimum requirements._
- **Installation Scripts:** Back by popular demand, the installation scripts have returned and are better than ever. See the installation instructions below for details on how to use them.
- **RPM Package Signing Key:** The key used to sign RPM packages has changed. We now sign packages using SHA256, providing better support to the community.
- **Questions and concerns:** To resolve questions and discuss concerns about this update we've opened this discussion space [New distribution&#39;s packages](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/discussions/#123456)
